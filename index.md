Currently finishing my MS of Computer Science in The George Washington University with a learning focus on data science and web development. Always looking to learn new things. And with the belief that there's nothing you can't achieve with hard work.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Classifiers and prediction systems for sports. 
- Creating and Amazon Echo system to find out when the next bus is coming in a stop location.
